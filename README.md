Developing a tool for the visually impaired people is not a recently emerged problem. But developing a computer aided tool is a still 
developing area. The aim of all these systems is to help the user in navigation without the help of a second person. There are several 
works using computer vision techniques. But there is no existing method that help to solve the all basic needs of blind person. 
This project presents a comprehensive scheme for reconstructing a three-dimensional (3D) model from a stereo camera via multi-view 
calibration. The depth information is useful so as to estimate the actual position of the target object. It is an essential parameter 
that can allow visualization from multiple perspectives. We provide an improved method for detecting objects and calculating the distance 
of these objects using stereo vision in real time. The stages involved include camera calibration, image rectifying, disparity calculation,
and three dimensional reconstruction. Results show that objects located from 60cm up to 208cm are properly measured for their distances, 
with an average error of 3cm. The precision of the measurement also depends on the quality of the calibration.
